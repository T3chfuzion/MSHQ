        <h2>The History of Judo</h2>
        <p>Judo is a modern martial art, combat, and Olympic sport created in Japan. It was developed in 1882 by Jigoro Kano, who adapted traditional Japanese jujutsu techniques into a more systematized form of self-defense, training, and competition.</p>
        <p>Judo focuses on throws, pins, joint locks, and strangles, with an emphasis on using an opponentâ€™s energy and balance against them. The term "Judo" translates to "the gentle way," symbolizing the philosophy of yielding and applying techniques with maximum efficiency with minimal effort.</p>
        <p>Judo made its Olympic debut at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, and today it is practiced by millions of people worldwide, from beginners to Olympic champions.</p>
