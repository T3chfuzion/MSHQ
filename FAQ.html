                    <h3>What is the difference between Judo and other martial arts?</h3>
                    <p>Judo focuses primarily on throws, pins, and submissions rather than striking techniques like punches or kicks. It is designed to use the opponent's energy and balance against them. Unlike some other martial arts, Judo also emphasizes respect, discipline, and mutual welfare.</p>
